# Hello There,


I am **Dip** and I was practicing ***kafka***. If everything Goes  well,
it's highly possible I am now at architect level where I dont need to code anymore. 
Thats **github**, for reminding me I can code!

## So,
Here run 

    node producer.js

to make some topic and inject data on them.

And, run 

    consumer.js

to have a realtime watch on them.

Wallah!! So easy. But people are now using kafka js instead of kafka-node!
